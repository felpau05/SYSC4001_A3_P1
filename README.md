# SYSC 4001 – Assignment 3 (Part 1)

This project implements three CPU scheduling algorithms for a single-CPU system with fixed memory partitions:

- **RR** – Round Robin (100 ms quantum)
- **EP** – External Priority (non-preemptive)
- **EP_RR** – External Priority + Round Robin (preemptive + quantum)

The simulator models:

- Process states: `NOT_ASSIGNED`, `NEW`, `READY`, `RUNNING`, `WAITING`, `TERMINATED`
- Fixed-size memory partitions and first-fit allocation
- CPU bursts with optional I/O
- Basic performance metrics, written at the end of each run into `execution.txt`

---

## Features

- **Three schedulers in separate executables**
  - `RR` – time-sliced, no priority
  - `EP` – external priorities, non-preemptive
  - `EP_RR` – preemptive priority with RR within each priority level
- **State-based simulation**
  - Explicit transitions between all OS process states
  - Every transition logged with timestamp, PID, old state, new state
- **Memory management**
  - Fixed partitions (40, 25, 15, 10, 8, 2)
  - First-fit assignment when a process becomes `NEW`
  - Partition released when the process terminates
- **I/O modelling**
  - CPU time counted per process
  - I/O requested every `io_freq` ms of CPU time (if `io_freq > 0`)
  - Process moves to `WAITING` for `io_duration` ms, then returns to `READY`
- **Batch test runner**
  - `run_all.sh` runs **all** `.txt` traces in `input_files/` with **all three** schedulers
  - Outputs stored in `output_files/` as `<basename>_<SCHED>.txt`

## Design choices & assumptions

### Priorities

- The original assignment spec (older PDF) used **external priorities** (separate input column).
- A later clarification changed this to “lower PID = higher priority”.
- This implementation keeps the **external priority** model for flexibility:

  - If the input line has **7 fields**, the 7th field is treated as `priority`.
  - Lower `priority` value = higher priority (e.g., 0 is highest).
  - If the input has only **6 fields**, `priority` defaults to `0` for all processes.
  - With equal priorities, `EP_RR` collapses to standard Round Robin, and `EP` collapses to FCFS.

### Context switch overhead

- Context switches (save/restore, mode switch, vector lookup, etc.) are **ignored** in this Part 1 scheduler simulator.
- Time advances only due to:
  - CPU execution
  - I/O duration

### “Too large for memory” processes

- Memory partitions are fixed: `[40, 25, 15, 10, 8, 2]`.
- If a process’s `size` is **greater than 40**, it can never be placed in any partition:
  - It still appears as `NOT_ASSIGNED → NEW` at arrival.
  - It is **never** moved to `READY` or `RUNNING`.
  - The termination check ignores such processes (they do not block simulation termination).

### Event ordering (for a RUNNING process in a 1 ms tick)

For each simulated millisecond when a process is `RUNNING`, the scheduler resolves events in this order:

1. **Check if the process has completed** its CPU burst  
   - If yes: `RUNNING → TERMINATED` and the partition is freed.
2. **Check if the process must issue I/O**  
   - Based on accumulated CPU time (`total_cpu_time % io_freq == 0`).  
   - If yes: `RUNNING → WAITING`, `io_duration` ms queued, no further checks for that tick.
3. **(EP_RR only)** Check if a higher-priority process is READY  
   - If such a process exists: preempt current process, `RUNNING → READY`, and schedule the higher priority one.
4. **(RR / EP_RR)** Check for **quantum expiry** (100 ms)  
   - If the quantum is consumed and **another READY process** of same or higher priority exists:
     - `RUNNING → READY`, process re-queued at the tail of its level.
   - If no competitor exists at that priority, the process continues to run.

EP (external priority, non-preemptive) only uses step 1 and 2; preemption does not occur mid-burst.

## Input format

Each line in an input file has either **6** or **7** comma-separated fields:

```text
PID, size, arrival_time, cpu_burst, io_freq, io_duration[, priority]
